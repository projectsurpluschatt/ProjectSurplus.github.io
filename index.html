			<h2>What is Project Surplus?</h2>
			<p>Project Surplus is an innovative and eco-friendly approach to feeding the rapidly growing population. The number of farms and ranches in the United States has decreased by 3% from 2012 to 2017 (1). That may seem small, but our population (currently 7.7 billion) is expected to rise to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11 billion by 2100 (2). This problem calls for a sustainable solution, and Project Surplus delivers that with our hybridized aquaponic and hydroponic mobile farms and gardens.</p>
