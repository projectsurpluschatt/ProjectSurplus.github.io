			<h2>What is Project Surplus?</h2>
			<p>Project Surplus is an innovative and eco-friendly approach to feeding the rapidly growing population.
				The number of farms and ranches in the United States has decreased by 3% from 2012 to 2017 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com
				/2019/04/11/census-of-agriculture-shows-continued-decline-in-number-of-us-farms.html">(1)</a>. That may seem small,
				 but our population (currently 7.7 billion) is expected to rise to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11 billion by 2100 <a href=
				 "https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/population/ ">(2)</a>.This problem calls for a sustainable solution, and
				 Project Surplus delivers that with our hybridized aquaponic and hydroponic mobile farms and gardens.</p>
